		<p> STEAM is a student-led effort to ignite communications between disparate fields in academia, business, and thought. Our focus is broad but our starting point is uniting the Arts with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). </p>
		<p> On the surface, STEAM stands for STEM + Arts. But dig a bit deeper, and there's much more to it. Students at Brown wrote varied stories about STEAM - whether that means interdisciplinary collaboration, combining tech and the arts, or new ways of educating - and submitted them to this print zine. </p>
		<p> Typeset and Produced in 2019 </p>
